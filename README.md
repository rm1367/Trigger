<h1>Trigger: Stored Procedure</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project details the steps I took to create a Trigger in a SQL database. The Trigger is meant to execute a stored procedure in response to certain events in the data table or database. In addition to the creation of the Trigger, a sequence was also created to use in conjunction with the Trigger. These audits were stored inside a table that can be viewed in SQL.
